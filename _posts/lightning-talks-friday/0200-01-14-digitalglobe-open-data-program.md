In recent years, the use of satellite imagery has become an indispensable source of information for natural disaster response and emergency management. This talk will introduce DigitalGlobeâ€™s Open Data program, a new initiative to release high resolution imagery to support disaster recovery, at no cost. Pre and post event imagery over affected areas will be released so that end users can easily access and quickly exploit the imagery to turn the data into relevant, actionable information. Crowdsourcing results will subsequently be released to enable rapid damage assessments for first responders and mapping agencies to access. The importance and value of satellite imagery as a key data source for humanitarian openstreetmap mapping activities will be highlighted, and practical ways of using the satellite imagery for emergency management will be reviewed.
