"MAPS.ME built-in editor is simple, but simplicity means not only a few options to choose from, but also hidden features. You can add an amenity, but how to find a correct type? Renaming a shop is hard: "name" tag is well-protected by the app. Edits are not uploaded right away, so when are they? Why can not you edit a place, and why some people manage to do that? In this short talk I'll explain some non-obvious features of the most popular mobile editor."
