This is an interactive workshop where we will go through editing in OpenStreetMap using Mapillary detections. Mapillary processes every photo contributed to identify a range of objects. Many of these objects correspond to tags in OpenStreetMap and can thus be very useful for map editing. Weâ€™ll go through these detections and how to make the most of them when editing. Make sure to bring your laptop and a mouse if you have one.

You can find the [workshop guide here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Mapillary-Workshop-Y9yjbhliJs86FI9DSrEnG).
