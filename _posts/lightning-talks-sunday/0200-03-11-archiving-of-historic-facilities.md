In the Aizu area where there is Aizuwakamatsu City, serialized historical religious facilities are scattered.
These are called thirty-three goddards and are symbols of religious local residents.
Each religious facility has its own name, history and religious anecdotes, but its continuity depends on the enthusiasm of the residents.
In recognition of being a residents of Aizu, I recorded these as various open data in order to keep information on these historical facilities continuous.
We walked all the facilities to every corner, detailed data to OSM, documentation to Wikipedia, and field photos were released on Mapillary.
