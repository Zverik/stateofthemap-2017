This talk may be in Japanese. In this talk, Kohki will look at some of the mapping activity that's going on in Kakegawa,  Japan.  In order to progress a lifelong learning in something new and to provide services for communities and people with as a volunteer, we have been in progress of the OSM activities by a senior group since April 2016.  We'll also show some statistics of how we have progressed over a year, and consider how we have developed the mapping activities to encourage local communities to contribute.
